# Task 39

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   353B Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_15.md

**Result:**
The string you gave is a Unix/Linux filesystem permissions descriptor. Here's what each part of this string represents:

- `-rw-r--r--` - These indicate the permissions given to this file. `rw-` means the owner can read (r) and write (w) but not execute (-). The other `r--` and `r--` means that the group users and other users can only read and not write or execute this file.
- `1` - This represents the number of links (i.e., references) to this file.
- `cc` - This is the name of the user who owns the file.
- `staff` - This is the name of the group that owns the file.
- `353B`- This is the size of the file. Here, it's 353 bytes.
- `Jul 16 12:19` - This is the timestamp of the last time the file was modified.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_15.md` - This is the path and the name of the file.

So, in this case, a file named `task_15.md` located at `memory/results/tasks` which is 353 bytes in size, was last modified on July 16 at 12:19. The owner of the file ('cc') can read and write to it, while others can only read it. There is only one link to this file.
