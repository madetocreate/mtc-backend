# Task 25

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.4K Jul 16 12:17 memory/results/tasks/task_08.md

**Result:**
The text you posted looks like a Unix-style file listing.

Here's a breakdown of its meaning:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file permission. The first `-` means that it's a file. The next three characters (`rw-`) indicate the owner permissions (read and write). The following three (`r--`) denote the group permissions (read), and the last three (`r--`) are for everyone else (read). So, the owner (cc) can read and write the file, but everyone else can only read the file.
  
- `1` : This indicates the number of links to the file. In simple terms, this is the number of hard links (different paths referring to the same file data).
  
- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.
  
- `staff` : This is the group that the file belongs to.
  
- `1.4K` : This is the size of the file. Here, it's 1.4 Kilobytes.
  
- `Jul 16 12:17` : This is the last modified date and time of the file.
  
- `memory/results/tasks/task_08.md` : This is the file's path.

The file path indicates that it's a Markdown file, which is a plain text file format with some simple syntax for formatting text. Common uses are for creating README files or writing documentation.
