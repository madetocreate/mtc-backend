# Task 73

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   421B Jul 16 12:25 memory/results/tasks/task_43.md

**Result:**
This is a Linux format file listing, let me explain it step by step.

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions.
  
  - `-` denotes a file.
  - `rw-` indicates that the owner (`cc`) has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions, but not execute permissions (`-`).
  - `r--` indicates that the group (`staff`) has read (`r`) permissions but not write (`-`) or execute (`-`) permissions.
  - The final `r--` indicates that other users have read (`r`) permissions but not write (`-`) or execute (`-`) permissions.

- `1`: There is 1 link to this file.

- `cc`: The owner of the file is `cc`.

- `staff`: The user group assigned to this file is `staff`. 

- `421B`: The file size is 421 bytes.

- `Jul 16 12:25`: The file was last modified on July 16th at 12:25.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_43.md`: This is the path to the file. The file name is `task_43.md` and it's located in the `tasks` directory which is inside the `results` directory, which is itself inside the `memory` directory.
