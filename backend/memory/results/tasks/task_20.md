# Task 20

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   172B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_05_template.md

**Result:**
It seems you have provided a typical UNIX-like file listing. Here are the details:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file permissions. In this case, the owner (`cc`) can read/write, and the group (`staff`) along with others can only read the file.

- `1`: This indicates the number of links or directories inside this directory, which in this case is 1.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group the file belongs to.

- `172B`: This is the size of the file, which is 172 bytes.

- `Jul 16 11:12`: This is the last modification time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_05_template.md`: This is the path and name of the file. It looks like a Markdown (.md) file which is typically used for documentation and other text-based content.
