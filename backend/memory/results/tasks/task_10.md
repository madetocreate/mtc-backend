The information you've provided appears to be details about a file in a Unix or Linux-like system. Let's break down what each section means:

- `-rw-r--r--` : These are the file permissions. The first `-` indicates this is a file (directories are indicated with a `d`). The next three characters (`rw-`) are the owner permissions, indicating that the owner can read and write this file, but not execute it. The second three characters (`r--`) are the group permissions and the last three characters (`r--`) are the world permissions. Both group and world permissions can read this file only, they cannot write to or execute it.

- `1`: This is the number of links to the file.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.
