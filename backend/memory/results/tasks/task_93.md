# Task 93

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.7K Jul 16 12:32 memory/results/tasks/task_63.md

**Result:**
The string `-rw-r--r-- 1 cc staff 2.7K Jul 16 12:32 memory/results/tasks/task_63.md` is a typical output from the `ls -l` command in Unix-like operating systems, which provides detailed information about files and directories.

Each part of the line holds specific information:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part indicates the permissions of the file or directory. Each character has a meaning. The first character `-` means it's a file (d would mean directory). The next three characters `rw-` show the file's owner permissions (read and write). The next three `r--` show the group permissions (read only). The final three `r--` show all other users' permissions (also read only).
- `1`: This is the number of hard links (references) to the file or directory.
- `cc`: This is the owner of the file or directory.
- `staff`: This is the group the file or directory belongs to.
- `2.7K`: This is the size of the file or directory.
- `Jul 16 12:32`: This is the last modification date and time of the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_63.md`: This is the path to the file or directory.
