# Task 109

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.7K Jul 16 11:59 memory/results/tasks/task_79.md

**Result:**
The input you provided appears to be a Unix/Linux file listing. 

It's likely from the output of an `ls -l` command in the terminal which lists files in a directory along with their details.

Here's what the information represents:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. The 'r' represents read permission, 'w' write permission, and '-' signifies no permissions. They're grouped into three sets (owner, group, others), respectively.

- `1`: This is the number of links (directories or files) that link to this file.

- `cc`: The owner of the file. In your case 'cc' is the owner.

- `staff`: The group that owns the file. Here, the group is 'staff'.

- `1.7K`: The size of the file in kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:59`: The date and time the file was last modified.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_79.md`: The name and path of the file.

So, all put together, this line is showing a file named `task_79.md` which is about 1.7 kilobytes in size, owned by the user 'cc' and the group 'staff', and was last modified on July 16 at 11:59. The owner has read and write permissions, whereas the group and others only have read permissions.
