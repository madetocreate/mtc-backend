# Task 6

**Prompt:** grep -i "learning" memory/results/tasks/task_*.md | less

**Result:**
Your command is a combination of grep, a utility for searching plain-text data set for lines that match a regular expression, with less, a terminal pager program on Unix, Windows, and Unix-like systems.

Breaking down your command:

1. `grep -i "learning"`: This uses grep to search for the string "learning" in a case-insensitive manner (`-i` flag).

2. `memory/results/tasks/task_*.md`: This is your file pattern. It will search all .md (Markdown) files in the `memory/results/tasks/` directory that start with "task_".

3. `| less`: This pipes (`|`) the results of the grep command into the less command. Less allows you to scroll through the output in a page-wise fashion.

However, as an AI, I don't have access to a file system and can't perform this function for you. You will need to run this command in your own terminal.
