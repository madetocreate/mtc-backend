# Task 12

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff    18B Jul 16 11:08 memory/results/tasks/task_02_frontend_analysis.md

**Result:**
It seems you've copied a piece of output from a `ls -l` command on a Unix-based system like Linux or macOS. This output gives you detailed information about the file `task_02_frontend_analysis.md`. 

Details:
- `-rw-r--r--`: The file permissions. The first character `-` indicates that it's a regular file (as opposed to a directory `d` or link `l`). The next three characters `rw-` mean the owner can read and write the file, but not execute it. The next three `r--` indicate that the group can read but not write or execute the file. The final three `r--` mean other users can read but not write or execute the file.

- `1`: Number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially another name for the same file.

- `cc`: The owner of the file.

- `staff`: The group the file belongs to.

- `18B`: The file size is 18 bytes.

- `Jul 16 11:08`: The last modification time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_02_frontend_analysis.md`: The full name (and path) of the file.
