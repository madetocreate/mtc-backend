# Task 69

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   418B Jul 16 12:24 memory/results/tasks/task_39.md

**Result:**
It seems like you're displaying file information in a Unix/Linux style notation. Here's how to understand it:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file's permissions. There are 10 positions: 

   - The 1st character `-` indicates the type of the file. `-` means it's a regular file. `d` would mean it's a directory.
   - The next 3 characters `rw-` show the owner's (user's) permissions. `r` means the owner can read the file, `w` means the owner can write or modify the file. A `-` where `x` (execute) should be, means the owner can't execute the file as a program.
   - The next 3 characters `r--` reveal the group's permissions. In this case, members of the group can read, but not write or execute the file.
   - The final 3 characters `r--` represent the permissions for others. Again, they can read, but not write or execute the file.

- `1`: This indicates the number of links to the file. For files, this is typically 1 unless hard links are in use.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file, typically the person who created it.

- `staff`: This represents the group that owns the file.

- `418B`: This denotes the file's size in bytes (B). In this case, the file is 418 bytes.

- `Jul 16 12:24`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_39.md`: It's the full path and filename. In this case, the file is located in the `memory/results/tasks/` directory and named `task_39.md`. This name suggests it's a Markdown file.
