# Task 88

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.2K Jul 16 12:30 memory/results/tasks/task_58.md

**Result:**
The string you provided `-rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.2K Jul 16 12:30 memory/results/tasks/task_58.md` seems to be an output from a UNIX or Linux `ls -l` command on a file named `task_58.md` in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`. 

Here's a breakdown of what the different parts of the listing means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file permissions. 
The `-` in the beginning indicates that it is a regular file. The following `rw-` means the owner of the file (`cc`) can read and write the file. The next `r--` means the group (`staff`) has read-only privileges. The final `r--` indicates that all other users also have read-only access to the file.

- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. 

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group that owns the file.

- `2.2K`: This is the size of the file. It's 2.2 kilobytes large.

- `Jul 16 12:30`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_58.md`: This is the name of the file, including its path. The file name is `task_58.md` and it is stored in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`.
