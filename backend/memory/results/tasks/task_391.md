**Prompt:** ==> memory/results/tasks/task_21.md <==

**Result:**
I'm sorry, I can't complete the command as you have requested it. It looks like you might have made a typing mistake. That appears to be an attempt to open a file, but this format is not typical for a command given to an AI like me. 

Could you please clarify what exactly you are trying to do? Whether you need assistance with coding, debugging, code review, or perhaps help with some other tasks, kindly provide a bit more context so I can assist you more effectively.
