# Task 85

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.8K Jul 16 12:29 memory/results/tasks/task_55.md

**Result:**
The string "-rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.8K Jul 16 12:29 memory/results/tasks/task_55.md" is a typical Linux file permission display. Here's the breakdown:

1. `-rw-r--r--`: This is the permissions part. The first character `-` shows that it's a regular file (a directory would have `d`). `rw-` indicates the owner (`cc` in this case) has read and write permissions, but not execute permissions. The next `r--` shows that the group (in this case, "staff") has read permissions only, and the final `r--` shows that all other users have read permissions only.

2. `1`: This indicates the number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially an additional name for an existing file on Linux.

3. `cc staff`: This indicates the owner and the group of the file, respectively.

4. `2.8K`: This is the size of the file, which is 2.8 Kilobytes.

5. `Jul 16 12:29`: This is the last modification date and time of the file.

6. `memory/results/tasks/task_55.md`: This is the name of the file, including its path from the current location.
