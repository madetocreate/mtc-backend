# Task 113

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.7K Jul 16 12:42 memory/results/tasks/task_83.md

**Result:**
The text you've given appears to be a Unix-style file listing, presumably from a terminal command such as `ls -l`. Here's a breakdown to help you understand:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part tells you the permissions of the file. In this case, the user (owner) has read/write permissions, and the group and others have read permissions.
- `1`: This indicates the number of links to this file. In this case, there's just one link.
- `cc`: This is the name of the user or owner of the file.
- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to.
- `1.7K`: This is the size of the file. In this case, it's 1.7 kilobytes.
- `Jul 16 12:42`: This is the date and time the file was last modified. Here it shows the file was last modified on July 16 at 12:42.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_83.md`: Finally, this is the name of the file. The file is named `task_83.md` and it is located in the `tasks` directory, which is inside the `results` directory, which is inside the `memory` directory.
  
So in summary, this is a 1.7 kilobytes markdown file named `task_83.md`, last modified on July 16 at 12:42. The file is owned by a user named `cc` and belongs to a group named `staff`. The owner can read and write to this file, while others in the group and anyone else can only read this file.
