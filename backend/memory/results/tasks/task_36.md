# Task 36

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_13_template.md

**Result:**
The text you provided appears to be a Unix/Linux file system listing. 

Here's the breakdown of what it means:

1. `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file permissions. The first dash means it's a file (for directory, 'd' would be there). The series of 'r', 'w', 'x' characters define the permissions for the user, group, and others respectively. 'r' stands for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execute. In this case, the user (usually the owner of the file) has read and write permissions, while the group and others only have read permissions.

2. `1`: This indicates the number of links or directories inside the directory. If it's a file, usually the number is 1.

3. `cc`: It's the user owner of the file.

4. `staff`: It's the group owner of the file.

5. `173B`: This is the size of the file which here is 173 bytes.

6. `Jul 16 11:12`: This signifies the last modification date and time of the file.

7. `memory/results/tasks/task_13_template.md`: This last part is the full path and name of the file/directory. Here, the name of the file is 'task_13_template.md' and it's located in the directory at 'memory/results/tasks'.
