# Task 15

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff    18B Jul 16 11:08 memory/results/tasks/task_03_bots_overview.md

**Result:**
The provided information is a listing from a Unix-like operating system. Let’s break this down:

`-rw-r--r--` – this is the permission scheme for the file or directory. The first character '-' indicates it is a file. "rw" means the owner (the user 'cc') has read and write access. The two 'r-' groups after mean that the 'staff' group and other users only have read access.

`1` – This is the number of links to this file.

`cc` – This is the name of the owner of the file.

`staff` – This is the group that owns this file.

`18B` – This is the size of the file. So, the file size is 18 bytes.

`Jul 16 11:08` – This is the last modification time of the file.

`memory/results/tasks/task_03_bots_overview.md` – This is the pathname of the file. The file is named 'task_03_bots_overview.md', and it's inside the 'tasks' directory, which is inside the 'results' directory, which is inside the 'memory' directory. The .md extension suggests this is a Markdown file, typically used for documentation.

So, this is a 18-byte Markdown file named 'task_03_bots_overview.md', located in 'memory/results/tasks' directory. It was last modified on July 16th at 11:08. The file is owned by the user 'cc' and the group 'staff', with read and write permissions for the owner and only read permissions for the group and other users.
