# Task 8

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff    51B Jul 16 12:41 memory/results/tasks/task_01.md

**Result:**
This command is not a question but a listing output from a Unix/Linux system. Here's a breakdown of what it means:

- `-rw-r--r--` : These characters are the file permissions. The first `-` indicates if it's a directory (d) or file (-). `rw-` means the owner (cc) has read and write permission but not execute. The next `r--` and final `r--` mean that the group and others have only read permissions.

- `1` : This is the number of links (i.e., how many names the file has).

- `cc` : This is the name of the file's owner.

- `staff` : This is the name of the group that owns the file.

- `51B` : This is the size of the file.

- `Jul 16 12:41` : This is the time and date when the file was last modified.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_01.md` : This is the file's name. Here, it represents a Markdown file named `task_01.md` in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`.
