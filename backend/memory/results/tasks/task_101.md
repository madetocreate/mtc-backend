# Task 101

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 11:56 memory/results/tasks/task_71.md

**Result:**
This line is a listing for a file on a UNIX-based operating system, such as Linux or macOS. Here's a breakdown of its components:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. This tells you who can read, write or execute the file. 

    - The first `-` indicates that it is a regular file (a directory would have a `d`).
    - `rw-` means the owner (cc) can read and write the file but not execute it as a program.
    - The next `r--` means that members of the owner's group (staff) can only read the file.
    - The final `r--` means other users (outside of the owner and the group) can also only read the file.

- `1`: This indicates the number of links to the file. This is typically 1 unless a hard link to the file was created.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file, the user who has the permissions outlined above.

- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to. In this case, the group is 'staff'.

- `2.5K`: This is the size of the file. The file size is 2.5 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:56`: This is the time when the file was last modified. So this file was last modified on July 16 at 11:56 AM.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_71.md`: This is the name and location of the file. The file named `task_71.md` is in the directory `results/tasks` within the directory `memory`. File extension `.md` is typically used for Markdown files.
