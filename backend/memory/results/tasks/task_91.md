# Task 91

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.7K Jul 16 12:31 memory/results/tasks/task_61.md

**Result:**
The line you've provided is a listing output from a Unix or Linux-based system, typically displayed when you use the `ls -l` command in a terminal. Here is what it means:

`-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file's permissions. The first `-` means it's a regular file (as opposed to a directory, which would be represented with a `d`). The `rw` means the owner of the file (`cc`) has read and write permissions. The next `r--` means members of the file's group (`staff`) have read permissions. The final `r--` means anyone (other users on the system) have read permission. They do not have write or execute permissions.

`1`: This is the number of hard links to the file.

`cc`: This is the name of the user who owns the file. 

`staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to.

`2.7K`: This is the file's size, in this case 2.7 Kilobytes.

`Jul 16 12:31`: This is the last time the file was modified, i.e., July 16 at 12:31.

`memory/results/tasks/task_61.md`: This is the file's path and name. The file is called `task_61.md` and is located in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`.
