# Task 17

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.3K Jul 16 12:16 memory/results/tasks/task_04.md

**Result:**
This is a Unix/Linux file permissions listing, specifically for a file named `task_04.md`. Here's a breakdown:

1. `-rw-r--r--` - These are the permissions of the file. The first character `-` indicates it's a file (a `d` would indicate a directory). Then it's followed by three sets of permissions: `rw-` for the user who owns the file, `r--` for the group that owns the file, and `r--` for all other users. `r` stands for read permission, `w` for write permission, and `-` means no permission. So in this case, the owner can both read and write, while the group and others can only read the file.

2. `1` - This is the number of hard links to the file (a kind of point or reference to the file).

3. `cc` - This is the user or owner of the file.

4. `staff` - This is the group owner of the file.

5. `1.3K` - This is the size of the file, which is approximately 1.3 Kilobytes.

6. `Jul 16 12:16` - This is the last modification date and time of the file.

7. `memory/results/tasks/task_04.md` - This is the name and location of the file.
