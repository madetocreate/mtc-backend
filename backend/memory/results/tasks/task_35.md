# Task 35

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.4K Jul 16 12:18 memory/results/tasks/task_13.md

**Result:**
The given line appears to be a file listing in a Unix/Linux system. Here's how to interpret it:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file's permissions. The leading `-` represents it's a file (a `d` would mean directory). `rw-` means the user (owner) of the file can read and write but not execute the file. The next `r--` signifies that the group members can only read the file, and the final `r--` indicates that other users can also only read the file.
- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. It basically means the number of different paths leading to this file.
- `cc`: This is the owner of the file. In this case, a user named 'cc' owns the file.
- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to. In this case, the file belongs to the 'staff' group.
- `1.4K`: The size of the file. Here it is 1.4 Kilobytes.
- `Jul 16 12:18`: The date and time of the last modification of this file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_13.md`: This is the name of the file (including its path relative to the current directory). This file appears to be a markdown file as indicated by the extension `.md`, probably containing task details or notes. 

Therefore, this line represents a markdown file named `task_13.md` of size 1.4K, last modified on July 16 at 12:18. This file is owned by 'cc' and belongs to the 'staff' group. It can be read and written to by the owner, but the group members and other users can only read it.
