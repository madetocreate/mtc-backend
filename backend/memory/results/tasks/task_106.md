# Task 106

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 11:58 memory/results/tasks/task_76.md

**Result:**
It seems like you're providing a Unix/Linux file listing, which includes key details about a specific file.

Here's a breakdown of each field:

- `-rw-r--r--` This part is about the file permissions. The initial `-` indicates this is a file (not a directory, which would be `d`). The `rw-` means the owner (in this case `cc`) can read and write but not execute the file; `r--` means the group `staff` can read the file, but not write or execute; the final `r--` means all other users can also read the file, but not write or execute.

- `1` represents the number of hard links. This is the number of physical links to the file.

- `cc` is the owner of the file. The owner is usually the creator unless it has been changed.

- `staff` is the name of the group that owns the file.

- `2.5K` is the size of the file â€“ in this case, it's 2.5 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:58` is the last modification date and time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_76.md` is the complete file name and its path.

This command is often used in Unix/Linux systems for checking the details about files and directories. It's part of the command `ls -l`, which lists the contents of a directory in long format for more details.
