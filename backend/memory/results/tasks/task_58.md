# Task 58

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.0K Jul 16 12:22 memory/results/tasks/task_28.md

**Result:**
It seems you have posted a line showing the details of a specific file from a Unix/Linux terminal. The details are as follows:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file permission. The first hyphen indicates it's a file (a 'd' would indicate a directory). The next three characters 'rw-' means the owner of the file has read and write permissions but not execute. The next three 'r--' means that the members of the group the file belongs to have only read permissions, and the last three 'r--' means that others have only read permissions on this file.

- `1` : This represents the number of links to the file.

- `cc` : This is the username of the file owner.

- `staff` : This is the group that the file belongs to.

- `1.0K` : This is the size of the file, here it's 1.0K or 1.0 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:22` : This is the date and time of the last modification to the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_28.md` : This is the name of the file, which is located within the directories `memory/results/tasks/`. Since this filename ends with `.md`, we can conclude that this is a Markdown file.
