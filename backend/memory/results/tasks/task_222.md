# Task 222

**Prompt:** main()

**Result:**
It seems you want to define a `main` function. The syntax to do so can vary depending on the language that you are using.

- Here is an example in Python:
```python
def main():
    # Your code here
    return
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

- Here is an example in C:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   // Your code here
   return 0;
}
```

- Here is an example in Java:
```java
public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        // Your code here
    }
}
```

Please let me know if there are specific things you would like your `main` function to do.
