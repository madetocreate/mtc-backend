# Task 217

**Prompt:** except Exception as e:

**Result:**
The code you provided is usually part of a try/except structure and is used in Python error handling. In Python, when an error or exception occurs, the program will stop executing. To prevent this and handle the error within the code, you use try/except blocks. Here is an example usage of your code:

```python
try:
    # some code that could potentially throw an error
    divisor = 0
    result = 10/divisor
except Exception as e:
    # code to run when an error occurs
    print("An error occurred:")
    print(e)
```

The "Exception as e" portion of your snippet is catching any type of exceptions that could occur, broadly handling all errors. The exception caught is stored in the variable `e`, so you can interact with it or display it to get more information about what went wrong. In the given example, if a division by zero error occurs in the `try` block, it would be caught by the `except` block and it would print "An error occurred:", followed by a more detailed error message.
