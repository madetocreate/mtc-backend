**Prompt:** tail -40 memory_logs/task_history.log

**Result:**
As an AI text-based model, I don't have direct access to your system files due to privacy and security reasons. `tail -40 filename` is a command used in UNIX-based systems to view the last 40 lines of a file. In this case, you'd like to review the last 40 lines of the file `memory_logs/task_history.log`. You should run this command directly in your Terminal or Command Line Interface.
