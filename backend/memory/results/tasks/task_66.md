# Task 66

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.9K Jul 16 12:24 memory/results/tasks/task_36.md

**Result:**
That appears to be a Unix/Linux file permission string, let me break it down for you:

- `-rw-r--r--` This is the permission string. It dictates who can do what with the file:
    - The first `-` indicates this is a file. A `d` in this location would mean it is a directory.
    - `rw-` The first set of characters indicate the permissions the owner has. `rw-` means the owner (`cc` in this case) can read and write to the file but cannot execute it (as there would be an `x` there if they could).
    - The second `r--` means that the group (which is `staff` for this file) can read this file but not write or execute it.
    - The last `r--` means that all others (anyone not the owner or in the group) can also read this file but neither write nor execute it.

- `1` is the number of hard links to the file.

- `cc` is the owner of the file.

- `staff` is the group the file belongs to.
  
- `1.9K` is the size of the file.
  
- `Jul 16 12:24` is the last modified date and time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_36.md` is the name of the file.
