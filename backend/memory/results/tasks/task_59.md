# Task 59

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.2K Jul 16 12:22 memory/results/tasks/task_29.md

**Result:**
It appears you're displaying details of a file by using a command-line interface (CLI), possibly something like Linux's `ls -l`.

Here's a breakdown of what the information means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file's permissions. In this case, the user (`u`) has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions, the group (`g`) has read (`r`) permissions, and others (`o`) have read (`r`) permissions as well. The leading `-` signifies that this is a regular file (directory would be `d`, link would be `l`, etc).
- `1`: Number of links (in simple terms: how many names the file has).
- `cc`: The name of the file's owner.
- `staff`: The name of the group that owns the file.
- `1.2K`: The size of the file -- in this case, 1.2 kilobytes.
- `Jul 16 12:22`: The date and time the file was last modified.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_29.md`: The file's name. This file appears to be a Markdown (`.md`) file, which is a common format for text files.
