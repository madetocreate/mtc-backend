# Task 136

**Prompt:** Details: Dummy Export.

**Result:**
Sure, I'd be more helpful if I had more details about what you're trying to accomplish with your "Dummy Export". 

Are you wanting to export data from a particular platform or application? The term "Dummy Export" typically refers to exporting sample or placeholder data. 

Types of data that could be exported may vary from a database (MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server), spreadsheets (Excel), text files, or other formats like JSON or XML.

In some programming languages like Python, there are built-in libraries that you could use to write and export data into various files like Excel or CSV. 

For a more tailored approach, please provide me more information about what you're trying to accomplish.
