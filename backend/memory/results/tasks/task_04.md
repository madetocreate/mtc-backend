# Task 4

**Prompt:** ls -lh memory/results/tasks/task_*.md

**Result:**
I'm an AI language model developed by OpenAI and currently, I can't directly interact with your computer's system like executing shell commands. What you're trying to do is to list information for several markdown files that are located under "memory/results/tasks" directory.

`ls -lh path` is a common Linux command:

- `ls` is used to list files and directories.
- `-l` option is used to show details in a long listing format.
- `-h` option is used to show sizes in human-readable format (Kb, Mb, Gb, etc. instead of bytes).
- `memory/results/tasks/task_*.md` is the pattern you're matching. It will match any files under `memory/results/tasks/` directory which start with `task_` and have `.md` extension.

You would need to run this command in your computer's terminal to get the information you're looking for.
