# Task 5

**Prompt:** head -40 memory/results/tasks/task_*.md

**Result:**
I'm sorry for the confusion, but as an AI, I don't have direct access to your local file system, which includes the Unix-like commands such as `head`. 

However, If you're working on a Unix-like system and you want to see the first 40 lines of each markdown file in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`, you can use your terminal or command line interface and type the command you provided.

Here's what your command does:

- `head -40` command prints the first 40 lines of each given file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_*.md` specifies any `.md` files in the `memory/results/tasks/` directory which start with `task_`. The `*` is a wildcard character that matches any characters.

If you need help with code, I would be happy to assist you! Please provide the language and context for the best help.
