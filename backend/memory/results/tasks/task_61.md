# Task 61

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   578B Jul 16 12:22 memory/results/tasks/task_31.md

**Result:**
The line you've just posted represents file permission information, which would typically be seen when you list files in a Unix or Linux shell such as Bash using the `ls -l` command.

Breaking down each part of the information provided:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This describes the file permissions. There are 10 spots, with the first specifying the type of file, the following three for the owner's (user's) permissions, the next three for group permissions, and the last three for everyone else's permissions (other). In this particular case, the leading `-` indicates that this is a regular file (as opposed to a directory `d`, symbolic link `l`, etc.) `rw-` for user means the file owner can read and write, but not execute the file. `r--` for group and other means that both group members and others can only read the file.
- `1` : This shows the number of links (references to this file).
- `cc` : This is the user or owner of the file.
- `staff` : This is the group the file belongs to.
- `578B` : This is the size of the file. Here, it's 578 bytes.
- `Jul 16 12:22` : This is the last modification time of the file. The file was last changed on July 16th at 12:22.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_31.md` : This is the name of a file, in this case a Markdown file. It also shows the path to the file, showing it's in the `tasks` folder, inside the `results` folder, inside `memory`.
