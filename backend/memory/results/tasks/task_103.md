# Task 103

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 11:57 memory/results/tasks/task_73.md

**Result:**
It seems like you're showing me a file permission listing from UNIX or a UNIX-like operating system. Let's break it down:

`-rw-r--r--`: This is the permission string for the file. It can be broken down as follows:
- The first `-` indicates that this is a regular file (as opposed to a directory, symbolic link, or other special type of file).
- The next three characters `rw-` represent the permissions for the file owner. `r` stands for read, `w` for write, and `-` indicates no permission for execute.
- The following three `r--` are permissions for the group. The group has read access but not write or execute permissions.
- The last three characters `r--` are permissions for others. Others can also read this file but they can't write or execute it.

`1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. Hard links are essentially different pointers to the same file content.

`cc`: This is the owner of the file. 

`staff`: This is the group owning the file.

`2.5K`: This is the size of the file (2.5 kilobytes).

`Jul 16 11:57`: Stand for the last modification date and time of the file.

`memory/results/tasks/task_73.md`: This is the name/location of the file. It's a Markdown (.md) file. Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text.
