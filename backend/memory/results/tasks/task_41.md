# Task 41

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.6K Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_16.md

**Result:**
It seems like you've pasted a Unix/Linux filesystem permission string. Let me explain what it means.

`-rw-r--r--` is a typical permission string and it conveys the following information:

- The first character `-` indicates that this is a regular file. Other possible values are `d` for directory, `l` for symbolic link, `s` for socket, `p` for pipe, `b` for block device, `c` for character device.

- The next three characters `rw-` indicate the permissions for the file's owner. In this case, the owner can read (`r`) and write (`w`), but not execute (`-`) this file.

- The next three characters `r--` indicate permissions for the group the file belongs to. In this case, group members can read (`r`) the file, but they cannot write (`-`) or execute (`-`) it.

- The last three characters `r--` indicate permissions for other users. Like group members, other users can read (`r`) the file but cannot write or execute it.

`1` denotes the number of links. This number is typically 1 for files.

`cc` is the username of the user who owns the file.

`staff` is the group that the file belongs to.

`1.6K` is the size of the file.

`Jul 16 12:19` is the last modification time of the file.

Finally, `memory/results/tasks/task_16.md` is the name of the file. This file appears to be a Markdown file based on its `.md` extension.
