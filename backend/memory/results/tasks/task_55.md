# Task 55

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.9K Jul 16 12:21 memory/results/tasks/task_25.md

**Result:**
The text you've shared seems to be a file listing from a Unix/Linux based system, specifically a file named `task_25.md` that is located in the `memory/results/tasks/` directory. Here's a breakdown of each component:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part represents the file's permissions. The first `-` indicates that this is a regular file. The `rw-` means that the owner (cc) has read and write permissions but not execute. The next `r--` means that the group (staff) has read permissions. The last `r--` means that all other users have read permissions.
  
- `1`: This shows the number of links to the file. It is set to 1 indicating that there is only one link pointing to this file.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file. In this case, the user 'cc' is the owner.

- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to.

- `1.9K`: This shows the file size - roughly 1.9 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:21`: This section is a timestamp that indicates the last time the file was modified. It shows that the file was last modified on July 16 at 12:21.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_25.md`: This part is the pathname of the file. The file named `task_25.md` is located in the `memory/results/tasks/` directory.
