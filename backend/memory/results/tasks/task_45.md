# Task 45

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.1K Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_18.md

**Result:**
What you're seeing is a Linux/Unix command line output of file permissions, owner, size and last modification timestamp for a specific file. I'll break down each piece for you:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. It's broken down like this:

  - The first character `-` would be `d` if this was a directory. In this case, it's a file.
  
  - The next three characters `rw-` show the file permissions for the owner of the file. `rw-` means the owner can read and write, but not execute the file.

  - The following three `r--` shows the file permissions for the user group. `r--` means the group can read, but not write or execute it.

  - The final three `r--` shows the file permissions for all other users. `r--` also means they can read, but not write or execute the file.

- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. It basically counts the number of names that are associated with the file content on the disk.

- `cc`: This is the name of the file owner.

- `staff`: This is the name of the group that owns the file.

- `1.1K`: This is the size of the file. In this case, it's 1.1 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:19`: This is the date and time of the last modification to the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_18.md`: This is the pathname of the file.
