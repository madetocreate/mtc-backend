# Task 107

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 11:58 memory/results/tasks/task_77.md

**Result:**
The string you've presented here describes file permissions in UNIX/Linux systems. Here are what the different components refer to:

`-rw-r--r--`: This initial string is demonstrating the permissions related to the file. The first character `-` represents the type of the file. In this case, a `-` means it is a normal file. Other symbols could be `d` for directory, `l` for symbolic link, etc.

The following nine characters are divided into three sets, each containing three characters. These sets represent the read, write, and execute permissions respectively for three types of user groups:

- The first set `rw-` refers to the user who owns the file. Here, the user has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions but no execute permissions (`-`).
- The second set `r--` refers to the group that owns the file. In this case, group members can only read the file (`r`).
- The third set `r--` refers to all other users. Similar to the group, these users can only read the file (`r`).

`1`: This shows the number of hard links to the file. In this case, there is 1 hard link.

`cc `: This is the user who owns the file.

`staff`: This is the group that owns the file.

`2.1K`: This is the size of the file. 

`Jul 16 11:58`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

`memory/results/tasks/task_77.md`: This is the file or directory path.
