# Task 221

**Prompt:** if __name__ == "__main__":

**Result:**
It appears that you want to write a script that can be either imported as a module or run directly. Here's a simple example:

```python
def main():
    # Your main code goes here
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

In this code, `if __name__ == "__main__":` ensures that the `main()` function is only run when the script is executed directly, not when it is imported as a module. 

When a Python file is run directly, `__name__` is set to `"__main__"`. But when the same file is imported as a module, `__name__` would be set to the name of the file (without the '.py'). So `if __name__ == "__main__":` is just a way to confirm if the file is being run directly or not. If it is, the code within this if-block will be executed.
