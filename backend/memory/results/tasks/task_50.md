# Task 50

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_20_template.md

**Result:**
It appears you've listed a file from your system. The file is named "task_20_template.md". The information provided encompasses the permissions, ownership, size, last modification date, and the location of the file. Here's the breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--` represents the file's permissions. The 'r' stands for 'read', 'w' for 'write', and '-' for no permissions. This sequence can be broken down like this:
   - The first character `-` usually specifies if it's a file. A `d` in this place would mean it is a directory.
   - The next three characters `rw-` are the file owner's permissions, which means the owner can read and write but not execute the file.
   - The second set of three characters `r--` are the group permissions. Anyone in the file's group can read but can't write or execute the file. 
   - The final three characters `r--` represent the permissions for all other users. They can read the file but not write or execute.

- `1` : This is the number of links (i.e., how many times this file is hard-linked from different locations).

- `cc` : This indicates the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This indicates the group the file belongs to.

- `173B` : This is the size of the file, which is 173 bytes.

- `Jul 16 11:12` : This is the last modification timestamp of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_20_template.md` : This shows the path where the file is located.
I hope this helps! If you need to do something more specific with this file or you need information about a different command, please provide additional details.
