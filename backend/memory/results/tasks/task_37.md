# Task 37

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.3K Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_14.md

**Result:**
The text you've provided is actually a listing from a Unix-like command line interface, typically originating from an `ls -l` or `ls -ld` command. This is a command used to list files in a directory including their details. Here is a break-down of the given listing:

- `-rw-r--r--` indicates the file permissions. The first `-` says it's a regular file. The next three characters `rw-` mean that the owner of the file (in this case user 'cc') has permissions to read and write, but not execute the file. The next group `r--` means the members of the file group (in this case 'staff') have read permission only, not write or execute. The final group `r--` means other users have read permissions.

- `1` is a link count, which in the case of files, is usually 1 unless a hard link to the file has been created somewhere else in the file system.

- `cc` is the name of the owner of the file.

- `staff` is the group which the file belongs to.

- `1.3K` is the size of the file, in this case, 1.3 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:19` is the date/time that the file was last modified.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_14.md` is the name (and possibly the path) of the file. The file is a Markdown format file (`.md` extension), commonly used for READMEs and other documentation.
