# Task 112

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.4K Jul 16 12:00 memory/results/tasks/task_82.md

**Result:**
The string you've entered appears to be the representation of a Unix file with its permissions, size, date of last modification, and path.

Here are the parts broken down:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This shows the file permissions. The first `-` indicates it's a normal file (a `d` would represent a directory). The next three characters, `rw-`, indicate that the user who owns the file (`cc`) has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions. The next three characters, `r--`, represent the group's permissions, and in this case, the group can only read (`r`) the file. The final three characters, `r--`, show that other users can also only read (`r`) the file.

- `1`: This shows the number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially a reference or pointer to the file's data.

- `cc`: This is the username of the file's owner. In this case, the file is owned by the user `cc`.

- `staff`: This is the group name of the file's owner.

- `2.4K`: This is the size of the file. Here, the size is approximately 2.4 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:00`: This is the date and time of last modification of the file. Here, the last modified date appears to be July 16 at 12:00.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_82.md`: This is the file's location and filename. This file is named `task_82.md` and it's located in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`.
