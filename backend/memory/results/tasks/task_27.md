# Task 27

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   704B Jul 16 12:18 memory/results/tasks/task_09.md

**Result:**
The text you entered looks like command output from the `ls -l` command in a Unix-style operating system. `ls -l` is a command used to show detailed information about files and directories.

Here is a breakdown of the output you provided:

- `-rw-r--r--`: 
This is the file permissions string. It can be broken down as follows:
  - `-` indicates that this is a regular file. Different symbols will be displayed for directories (`d`), symbolic links (`l`), and others.
  - `rw-` shows that the owner of the file has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions, but not execute (`x`) permission.
  - `r--` indicates the user (group) permission, meaning members of the file's group have only read (`r`) permissions, and no write (`w`) or execute (`x`) permissions.
  - The final `r--` shows other users' permissions, which here again is read only, similar to the group permissions.
 
- `1` : This is the number of links (inodes) that point to this file.

- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This shows the group this file belongs to.

- `704B` : This is the size of the file, which is 704 bytes.

- `Jul 16 12:18` : This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_09.md` : This is the name (and path) of the file.

So, this output describes a regular file named `task_09.md`, which is located in the path `memory/results/tasks/`. The file was last modified on July 16 at 12:18, it is 704 bytes in size, it has one link pointing to it. The file is owned by a user named "cc" and belongs to the group "staff". The owner has read and write permissions, while the group members and other users have read-only permissions.
