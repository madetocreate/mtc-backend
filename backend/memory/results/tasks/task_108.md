# Task 108

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.0K Jul 16 11:58 memory/results/tasks/task_78.md

**Result:**
The string you've provided is a typical line from a *unix-style* file system listing (like youâ€™d get if you run the command `ls -l` in a terminal).

Here's a breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These 10 characters are the file permissions. The first character `-` denotes that it is a regular file (d would mean directory, l would mean link). `rw-` indicates that the owner of the file (cc) has Read and Write permissions. The next three characters `r--` indicate that the group (staff) has only Read permissions, and the last three `r--` also show that other users have only Read permissions to the file.

- `1`: This is the number of links (or directories) that contain a reference to this file. For most files, this will be 1.

- `cc`: This is the user owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group owner of the file.

- `2.0K`: This is the size of the file. In this case, it's 2.0 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:58`: This is the date of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_78.md`: Finally, this is the name (and path) of the file. This file is an Markdown file (.md file extension), which is often used for documentation or notes because it is easy to convert to HTML for viewing in a web browser.
