# Task 72

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.2K Jul 16 12:25 memory/results/tasks/task_42.md

**Result:**
The string you have provided appears to be a descriptor from a UNIX or Linux-based filesystem. It's detailing the properties of a file.

Here is what each part means:

1. `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file permissions section. The first character `-` signifies a regular file. The next set of three characters `rw-` means that the user (owner) has read and write permissions. The next set `r--` means that the group has read permission, and the final set `r--` means that all others have read access as well.

2. `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially a reference to the physical location of the file's data.

3. `cc`: This is the file owner. So the file task_42.md is owned by the user "cc".

4. `staff`: This is the group the file is associated with. In this case, the file is associated with the group called "staff".

5. `2.2K`: This is the size of the file. The file is 2.2 kilobytes.

6. `Jul 16 12:25`: This is the last modified date and time of the file. The file was last modified on July 16 at 12:25.

7. `memory/results/tasks/task_42.md`: This is the name and location of the file. The file named `task_42.md` is located in the `/memory/results/tasks/` directory.

In summary, you have a file named `task_42.md` that is 2.2 kilobytes in size, was last modified on July 16 at 12:25, is owned by the user 'cc', and is associated with the group 'staff'. The owner can read and write to the file, but others can only read it. It has 1 hard link and is located in the `/memory/results/tasks/` directory.
