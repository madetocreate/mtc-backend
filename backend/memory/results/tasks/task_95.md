# Task 95

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.0K Jul 16 11:54 memory/results/tasks/task_65.md

**Result:**
The information you provided appears to be output from a Linux or Unix command such as 'ls -l', indicating details for a particular file. Here's how you can decode it:

- `-rw-r--r--` : These are the file permissions. The first character `-` indicates it's a regular file (a directory would have `d`, for example). The following three sets of characters indicate the permissions for the user that owns the file, the group that owns the file, and all others, respectively. `rw-` means the user can read and write, but not execute the file. `r--` indicates that the group and others can read the file, but not write or execute it.

- `1` : This is the number of hard links to the file in the filesystem.

- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This is the group that owns the file.

- `2.0K` : This is the size of the file. In this case, it is 2.0 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:54` : This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_65.md` : This is the name (including the relative path) of the file.
