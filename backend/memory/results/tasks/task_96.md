# Task 96

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 11:54 memory/results/tasks/task_66.md

**Result:**
This is not a question but rather a line typically seen in the Linux terminal. Here's what it means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These symbols are representative of permissions for three different types of users - the file owner, the group, and all other users. In this case, the user 'cc' (file owner) has read/write (rw) permissions, the group has only read (r) permissions, and all other users also have only read (r) permissions.
- `1`: This represents the number of hard links to the file.
- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.
- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to.
- `2.1K`: This is the size of the file.
- `Jul 16 11:54`: This is the last modification time of the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_66.md`: This is the path and the name of the file.

So in plain English, this information could be interpreted as: "User 'cc' from the 'staff' group owns a file called 'task_66.md' (located at 'memory/results/tasks/'). The file was last modified on July 16 at 11:54, it's 2.1KB in size and its permissions allow the owner to read and write to this file, while everyone else in the 'staff' group and all other users can only read this file."
