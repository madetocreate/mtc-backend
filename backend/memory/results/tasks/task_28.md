# Task 28

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   172B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_09_template.md

**Result:**
The string you provided seems like file permission information on a Unix-like operating system such as Linux or macOS. Here's a breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions.
  - `-` : This indicates it's a file (directories would be marked with a `d`, i.e., `drwxr-xr-x`)
  - `rw-` : The owner of the file can read and write (`rw`) to the file, but not execute it (as there's no `x`). 
  - `r--` : Members of the file's group can read (`r`), but not write or execute it.
  - `r--` : Others (not the owner or in the file's group) can also read (`r`), but not write or execute it.

- `1`: This is the number of links (inodes) to the file. In most cases, this will be 1 unless a hard link to the file is created.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group the file belongs to.

- `172B`: This is the size of the file.

- `Jul 16 11:12`: This is the last modification date and time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_09_template.md`: This is the name/path of the file.

Please let me know if you need detailed understanding about any other aspect of Linux/Unix files!
