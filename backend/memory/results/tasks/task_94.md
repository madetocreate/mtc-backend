# Task 94

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.2K Jul 16 12:32 memory/results/tasks/task_64.md

**Result:**
It seems like you pasted a Linux command or output. This is a representation of file permissions, ownership, file size, last modification date, and the file name in a Unix or Linux system.

Here's a breakdown:

- `\`-rw-r--r--\`: These are the permissions for the file. It's broken down into four sections:
  - The first `-` signifies whether this is a directory (denoted by `d`) or a file (denoted by `-`). Here, it indicates this is a file.
  - The next three characters `rw-` represent the owner's permissions. Here, the owner `cc` can read (`r`) and write (`w`), but not execute (`-`) the file.
  - The second three characters `r--` represent the group's permissions. The group `staff` can only read (`r`) this file.
  - The last three characters `r--` represent everyone else's permissions. They can also only read (`r`) this file.
  
- The `1`: Next is the number of links to the file. It signifies how many names the file has.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group that owns the file.

- `2.2K`: This is the size of the file. Here, it's 2.2 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:32`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_64.md`: Finally, this is the name of the file.

In summary, this line represents a file named `task_64.md` that was last modified on July 16th at 12:32. The file size is 2.2K. The owner `cc`, part of the `staff` group, can read and write to it. Both the owner's group and others can only read the file.

Let me know how else I can help!
