# Task 89

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 12:30 memory/results/tasks/task_59.md

**Result:**
The string you provided is a summary of permissions, size, ownership, modification date, and location for a file in a UNIX-like system, such as Linux, macOS, etc.

Here's a breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These symbols represent the permission settings for the file. The first character `-` indicates it's a regular file. The next three characters `rw-` are the permissions for the owner of the file (read and write permission). The next three `r--` are for the members of the group that owns the file (read only). The final `r--` are permissions for others (again, read only).

- `1`: This is how many hard links the file has. A hard link is simply an additional name for an existing file on Linux or Unix-like systems.

- `cc`: This is the username of the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group that the file is associated with.

- `2.5K`: This is the size of the file. In this case, the file is 2.5 Kilobyte (K).

- `Jul 16 12:30`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_59.md`: This is the location and name of the file in the directory structure. The file is called `task_59.md`, and it resides in the `tasks` directory, which is itself in the `results` directory within the `memory` directory. The `.md` extension suggests that this is a Markdown file.
