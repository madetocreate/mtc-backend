# Task 32

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_11_template.md

**Result:**
The command you've entered is not a command, but a line you might see in a UNIX/LINUX terminal after using the `ls -l` command, which lists the contents of a directory in detailed format. Here's a breakup of what these details mean:

**-rw-r--r--:** These are the file permissions. The first "-" indicates that this is a file. The next three letters "rw-" say that the file owner (cc) can read and write to the file, but not execute it. The second group "r--" means that the group (staff) can read the file but not write to it or execute it. The final group "r--" means that all other users can read the file but nor write to it or execute it.

**1:** This is the number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially a label for a physical location on the hard drive - so if you have two hard links to the same file, deleting one will not delete the file from disk, as there is still one hard link pointing to it.

**cc:** This is the owner of the file.

**staff:** This is the group owner of the file.

**173B:** This is the size of the file, 173 Bytes.

**Jul 16 11:12:** This is the last modified date and time of the file.

**memory/results/tasks/task_11_template.md:** This is the file's name and its path.
