# Task 13

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   172B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_02_template.md

**Result:**
The information provided looks like an output from the `ls -l` command in a Linux-based system, which gives details about a file or directory.

Here's the breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file permission where the first `-` denotes it's a file (directory would be `d`). The next three letters `rw-` show that the owner has read and write permission but not execute. The next three `r--` and last three `r--` imply that the group and others (anyone else) only have read permission.
- `1`: This represents the number of hard links to the file.
- `cc`: This is the name of the owner of the file. 
- `staff`: This is the group the file belongs to. 
- `172B`: This is the size of the file, measuring 172 Bytes. 
- `Jul 16 11:12`: The date and time when the file was last modified.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_02_template.md`: This is the complete path of the file.

So, overall, the given information tells about a markdown file `task_02_template.md` with a size of 172 Bytes, last modified on July 16th at 11:12. Only the owner `cc` belonging to the group `staff` can write on this file, but others can read it.
