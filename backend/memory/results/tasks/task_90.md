# Task 90

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 12:31 memory/results/tasks/task_60.md

**Result:**
This is a Unix-style file listing. Let me break down what this listing is saying:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file permissions string.
    - First character `-` indicates it's a regular file (not a directory `d`, link `l`, etc.).
    - `rw-` is the user permissions which means the owner (user) can read and write but not execute this file.
    - `r--` is the group permissions which means users in the file group can read this file, but can't write or execute it.
    - The final `r--` is the permissions for other users, which means users not in the file's group can read this file, but can't write or execute it.

- `1` : This is the number of hard links to the file.

- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This is the group the file belongs to.

- `2.5K` : This is the size of the file.

- `Jul 16 12:31` : This is the last modification time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_60.md` : This is the name of the file (in this case, it's a Markdown file).
