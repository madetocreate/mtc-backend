# Task 19

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.2K Jul 16 12:17 memory/results/tasks/task_05.md

**Result:**
Sure, it looks like you're looking at file permissions and file information from a Unix/Linux style command line output. 

Let's break this down: 

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. The first `-` means this is a regular file (as opposed to a directory `d` or a link `l`). The next three characters `rw-` represent the permissions for the user that owns the file (read and write). The next three characters `r--` represent permissions for the group that owns the file (read only). The last three characters `r--` represent permissions for all other users (read only).

- `1`: This is the number of links to this file. In your case it is 1 as it seems not to be linked.

- `cc`: This is the user who owns the file.

- `staff`: This is the group that owns the file.

- `1.2K`: This is the size of the file.

- `Jul 16 12:17`: This is the date and time the file has last been modified.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_05.md`: This is the filepath for the file.

This command typically would be derived from a `ls -l` command.
