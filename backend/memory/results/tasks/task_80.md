# Task 80

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 12:27 memory/results/tasks/task_50.md

**Result:**
It seems like you've pasted a directory listing from a Unix-based system such as macOS or Linux.

This line describes a file in the system. Let's break it down:

- `-rw-r--r--` is the permission on the file. 
   - `-` indicates it's a regular file (not a directory or link).
   - `rw` indicates that the owner (in this user ID category) can read and write to this file.
   - `r` indicates that a member of the group (in this group category) can read this file.
   - The final `r--` indicates that any other user on this system can read this file.

- `1` is the number of hard links to the file. A hard link is essentially another name for the file.

- `cc` is the owner of the file.

- `staff` is the group that the file belongs to.

- `2.1K` is the size of the file. In this case, it is 2.1 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:27` is the last modified date and time of the file. 

- `memory/results/tasks/task_50.md` is the path to the file.
