# Task 76

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.3K Jul 16 12:26 memory/results/tasks/task_46.md

**Result:**
The string "-rw-r--r-- 1 cc staff 1.3K Jul 16 12:26 memory/results/tasks/task_46.md" you showed is a standard Unix/Linux file listing.

Let's break down its components:

- "-rw-r--r--": This is the file permission string. The leftmost "-" indicates this is a regular file (d would denote a directory, l a link, etc.). The next three characters "rw-" indicate the owner permissions (read and write). The next three "r--" are the group permissions (read-only). The last three "r--" are the permissions for other users (also read-only).
  
- "1": This number indicates the number of hard links to this file.

- "cc": This indicates the owner of the file.

- "staff": This is the group the file belongs to.
  
- "1.3K": This is the size of the file.
  
- "Jul 16 12:26": This is the date and time of the last modification of this file.

- "memory/results/tasks/task_46.md": This is the name of the file (including its path). 

Hope this clarifies your doubts!
