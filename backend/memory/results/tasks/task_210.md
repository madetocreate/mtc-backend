# Task 210

**Prompt:** handler.setFormatter(formatter)

**Result:**
It seems like you're trying to set a formatter for a handler in Python's logging module. Take a look at this basic example:

```python
import logging

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Set level of logging (default is WARNING. Other levels are INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, CRITICAL)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a handler. You could use FileHandler for logging to a file.
handler = logging.StreamHandler()

# Create a formatter. You could specify the format string
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Add the formatter to the handler
handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the handler to the logger
logger.addHandler(handler)

# Test the logger
logger.info("This is a test log message.")
```

In this code:

- We create a `logger`, which is the main object which your application will interact with.
- The `logger` sends the log messages it receives to one or more `handlers`, which decide what to do with the messages.
- In this case, we've used a `StreamHandler`, which writes log messages to a stream (which could be a file, or something else). You might also use a `FileHandler`, which would write the log messages to a file.
- Each `handler` can have a `formatter`, which is responsible for converting the log message into text. This is where handler.setFormatter comes into the picture. You are specifying the formatter object ('formatter' in this case) for your logging events. The format string in `Formatter` uses percent-style formatter strings to decide how to display the information.
