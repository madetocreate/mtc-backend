# Task 43

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_17.md

**Result:**
This is a representation of file permissions on a Unix-based system (like Linux or MacOS).

- `-rw-r--r--` - this portion describes the permissions for the file.
	- `rw-` - the owner (user) can read (`r`) and write (`w`) the file but not execute it (`-`)
	- `r--` - the members of the owner's group can read the file, but cannot write (`-`) or execute (`-`) it.
	- `r--` - others (not the owner, not in the owner's group) can read the file, but not write (`-`) or execute (`-`) it.
    
- `1` - this is the number of hard links (references to a file on the filesystem).

- `cc` - this is the owner/creator of the file. 

- `staff` - this is the group owner of the file.

- `2.1K` - this is the size of the file. 

- `Jul 16 12:19` - this is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_17.md` - this is the file path and name. The file is a markdown file (`.md` extension).
