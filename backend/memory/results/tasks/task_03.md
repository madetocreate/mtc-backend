# Task 3

**Prompt:** cc@Cs-MacBook-Pro ~ % cd ~/creator_engine/backend

**Result:**
It seems you would like to change the working directory in your terminal. The command you've posted is usually executed in your terminal to do so.

If you are facing a challenge, for many scenarios, I can provide potential solutions:

1. Directory does not exist: Make sure the `creator_engine/backend` directory exists in your home directory.

2. Permission denied: Check if your user has the necessary rights to access the directory.

3. Command not recognized: Ensure your terminal is recognizing `cd` as change directory command. `cd` command is universal for Unix/Linux/Mac terminals while works for Windows' cmd too. If you're using PowerShell, use `Set-Location` instead.

Just to be clear, as a text-based AI model, I can't perform commands in your terminal. I can only guide on how to do it.
