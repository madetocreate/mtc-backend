# Task 98

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 11:55 memory/results/tasks/task_68.md

**Result:**
The entry `-rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 11:55 memory/results/tasks/task_68.md` represents a file on a Unix or Unix-like system.

Here are the details you can infer from it:

- `-rw-r--r--` is the permission for the file. The user (`cc`) has read and write permissions, while the group (which in this case is `staff`) and others have only read permissions.

- `1` represents the number of hard links to the file.

- `cc` is the owner of the file.

- `staff` is the group the file belongs to.

- `2.1K` indicates the size of the file, which is 2.1 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:55` is the last modification time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_68.md` is the file or directory path.

So, effectively, this information is telling you that a user named "cc" has a file on their system under the path 'memory/results/tasks/task_68.md', the size of the file is 2.1 kilobytes, and it was last modified on July 16 at 11:55. It also tells you that "cc" can read and write to this file, but all other users can only read this file.
