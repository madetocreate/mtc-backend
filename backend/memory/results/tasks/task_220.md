# Task 220

**Prompt:** logger.warning("Eine Warnung")

**Result:**
It seems you're looking to log a warning message. Here is how you would typically do that in Python using the standard `logging` library:

```python
import logging

logging.warning("Eine Warnung")
```
This will log the message "Eine Warnung" to the console or wherever you have logging set to direct its output. By default, the logging level is set to `WARNING`, so this message will always be logged unless you change the logging configuration.
