# Task 30

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_10_template.md

**Result:**
The string you've given seems to be information about a file in a Unix-based system, typically obtained using the `ls -l` command. Lets break it down:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file permission. The first `-` signifies it's a file (a directory would be `d`). The following characters stand for the owner's, group's, and others' permissions respectively (read, write, execute). In this case, the owner (`cc`) can read and write (`rw-`), the group (`staff`) can only read (`r--`), and others can also only read (`r--`).

- `1` : This is the number of hard links to the file.

- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This is the group the file belongs to.

- `173B` : This is the size of the file. Here it's 173 Bytes.

- `Jul 16 11:12` : This is the last modified time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_10_template.md` : This is the file name with its path.
