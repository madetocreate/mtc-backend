# Task 60

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   103B Jul 16 12:22 memory/results/tasks/task_30.md

**Result:**
This output is from a command in a UNIX or Unix-like operating system, specifically the `ls -l` command which gives you the long format listing of a file or directory.

Let's break it down:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the protection string. The first character `-` denotes that this is a regular file (directory would be `d`). `rw-` indicates the owner of the file has read and write permissions but not execute. The next `r--` and the last `r--` mean that the group users and others have only read permissions on the file.

- `1` : This is the file's link count. Typically this is 1 unless we create a hard link to the file.

- `cc`: This is the name of the file's owner. 

- `staff`: This is the name of the group that owns the file.

- `103B`: This is the size of the file. In this case it's 103 bytes.

- `Jul 16 12:22`: This is the last modified time of the file. 

- `memory/results/tasks/task_30.md`: This is the name of the file and its path relative to the current directory. 

So this output is showing the details of a file named `task_30.md` in the directory `memory/results/tasks/`, which is 103 bytes in size, owned by 'cc' and 'staff', with read and write permissions for the owner, and only read for the group and others. The file was last modified on July 16th at 12:22.
