# Task 14

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff    49B Jul 16 12:40 memory/results/tasks/task_03.md

**Result:**
The input provided seems like a typical line of output from a Terminal or Unix/Linux command line interface, showing details about a file named `task_03.md`.

Here's a breakdown of what each piece of information means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the permissions for the file. The breakdown is as follows:

    - The first character `-` indicates it is a file. If it were a directory, it would be `d`.
    - The next three characters `rw-` show the user's permissions. In this case, the user can read (`r`) and write (`w`) to the file but not execute it (`-`).
    - The next three characters `r--` show the group's permissions. Here, the group can read the file but not write or execute.
    - The last three characters `r--` show other users' permissions. Again, other users can only read the file.

- `1`: This represents the number of hard links to this file.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group owner of the file.

- `49B`: This stands for the size of the file. In this case, the file is 49 bytes.

- `Jul 16 12:40`: This is the last modification time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_03.md`: This is the full path to the file.
