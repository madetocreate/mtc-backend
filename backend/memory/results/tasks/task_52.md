# Task 52

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.5K Jul 16 12:20 memory/results/tasks/task_22.md

**Result:**
The line you have mentioned illustrates output from an `ls -l` command in a Unix-like system, showing the details of a file named `task_22.md`. 

Here's a breakdown of the components:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. Here, the owner (`cc`) has read and write permissions (`rw-`), and the group and others have only read permissions (`r--`).
- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file. In this case, it's `1`.
- `cc`: This is the username of the file owner (user who owns the file).
- `staff`: This is the group ownership of the file. Every file is associated with a user who is the owner and a group that owns the file. `staff` is the group that owns the file.
- `1.5K`: This indicates the size of the file which is `1.5 kilobytes`.
- `Jul 16 12:20`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_22.md`: This is the file name. The file `task_22.md` is located in the directory `tasks` which is in `results` directory inside the `memory` directory. 

So the line describes a file named `task_22.md`, located in the path `memory/results/tasks/`, belonging to the user `cc` and the group `staff`, last modified on July 16th at 12:20, with a size of 1.5 kilobytes.
