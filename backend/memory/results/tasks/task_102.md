# Task 102

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.6K Jul 16 11:56 memory/results/tasks/task_72.md

**Result:**
It seems like you've posted a result of the `ls -l` command, which lists details about a file or directory in Unix and Unix-like operating systems. 

Here's a breakdown of the results:

`-rw-r--r--`: The file's permissions. This can be read as follows:

- `-`: It's a normal file (a directory would be indicated with a 'd')
- `rw-` : The owner has 'read' and 'write' permissions
- `r--` : The group has 'read' permissions
- `r--` : Other users have 'read' permissions

`1`: Number of links or directories inside this directory (for directories only).

`cc`: The owner of the file

`staff`: The group the file belongs to

`1.6K`: The size of the file

`Jul 16 11:56`: The date and time of last modification

`memory/results/tasks/task_72.md`: The name of the file

So, the `task_72.md` file is a normal file that's 1.6K in size, and last modified on July 16 at 11:56. The owner (named 'cc') can read and write to the file, while the 'staff' group and other users only have read permissions.
