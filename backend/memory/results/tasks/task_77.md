# Task 77

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.9K Jul 16 12:26 memory/results/tasks/task_47.md

**Result:**
The string you have written down seems to be a listing of a file in a Unix-based system.

Here is a briefing of what each field of information represents:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This represents the file permissions. `rw-` means the owner has read and write permissions, but not execute permissions. Two instances of `r--` imply that the group and other users only have read permissions.
- `1`: This is the number of links to the file.
- `cc`: This is the username of the file's owner.
- `staff`: This represents the group to which the file belongs.
- `1.9K`: This is the size of the file (1.9 kilobytes).
- `Jul 16 12:26`: This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_47.md`: This is the name and location of the file. The file `task_47.md` is within the sub-directory `tasks` which is in the `results` directory inside the `memory` directory.

Essentially, this is the `task_47.md` file, owned by the user `cc` and group `staff`. It was last modified on July 16 at 12:26. The size of this file is 1.9KB. Its permissions indicate that the owner can read and write the file, while the rest can only read it.
