# Task 49

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.3K Jul 16 12:20 memory/results/tasks/task_20.md

**Result:**
It seems like you're pointing to a file on a Unix or Linux system, specifically, a file named "task_20.md" in the "memory/results/tasks/" directory.

The long string `-rw-r--r--` at the beginning is a typical way of displaying file permissions on Unix/Linux operating systems:

- `-rw-r--r--` can be broken down into four parts:
  1. `-` indicates the type of file. In this case, it's a regular file (denoted by -). If it was a directory, it would be shown as `d`.
  2. `rw-` is for user (owner) permissions, where 'r' stands for read, 'w' for write and '-' indicating no execute permissions.
  3. `r--` is for group permissions, where 'r' stands for read, and the following '--' shows no write or execute permissions.
  4. The last `r--` is for others (everyone else), and functions the same way as it does for group permissions.

`1` after the permissions is the number of hard links to the file. 

`cc` is the owner of the file and `staff` is the group that owns the file.

`1.3K` is the size of the file.

`Jul 16 12:20` is the last modified time of the file.

`memory/results/tasks/task_20.md` is the name of the file (including its path).
