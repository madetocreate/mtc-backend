# Task 29

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.2K Jul 16 12:18 memory/results/tasks/task_10.md

**Result:**
It appears you've posted a Unix-style file listing. This is typically seen in a terminal when you're listing files in a directory. Let's break it down:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. The first character `-` indicates that this is a regular file (a directory would be `d`). The next three characters `rw-` are for the owner's permissions, which here are read and write. The following `r--` is for group permissions, which is read only. The final `r--` is for others' (everyone else's) permissions, which is also read only.
  
- `1`: This indicates the number of links to the file. In this case, there's only one link.

- `cc`: This is the file's owner. In this case, the owner is a user named 'cc'.

- `staff`: This is the group that the file belongs to. 

- `1.2K`: This is the file's size. It's approximately 1.2 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:18`: This is the last modified date and time of the file. It was last changed on July 16 at 12:18.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_10.md`: This is the file's path, showing where it is stored in your file system.

All together, this means you have a file named `task_10.md` that is approximately 1.2KB in size, which was last modified on July 16, at 12:18. It's a regular file owned by the 'cc' user and belongs to the 'staff' group. The file is readable and writable by its owner and only readable by the group and others.
