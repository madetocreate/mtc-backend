# Task 21

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.2K Jul 16 12:17 memory/results/tasks/task_06.md

**Result:**
It appears you've provided information in a Unix-style file listing. The information in the format you provided is commonly displayed in response to the "ls -l" command which lists information about files and directories.

The "-rw-r--r--" section represents the file permissions. It tells us that this is a regular file (as denoted by the "-") and the user who owns the file ("cc") has read and write permissions (as denoted by the "rw-"), while the group members ("staff") and others have only read permissions (as represented by the "r--").

"1" indicates the number of links to the file. 

"cc" is the user who owns the file, "staff" is the group that owns the file. 

"1.2K" is the size of the file. 

"Jul 16 12:17" is the last modified date and time. 

Finally "memory/results/tasks/task_06.md" is the path or name of the file. Here it tells that this is a mark down file named "task_06.md" which is located in the "tasks" directory under "results" directory under "memory".
