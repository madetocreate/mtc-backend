**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.4K Jul 16 12:27 memory/results/tasks/task_49.md

**Result:**
The line you pasted is a file listing output from a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system command line (usually `ls -l`). Let me break it down and explain each part for you:

- `-rw-r--r--` is the file permissions string: This represents who has permissions to read, write, and execute the file. '-' means no permission, 'r' means read permission, 'w' means write permission and 'x' means execute permission.
  - The first symbol '-' indicates that this is a normal file (a directory would be indicated by 'd').
  - The next three characters `rw-` indicate that the file's owner (user) has read and write permissions.
  - The next three characters `r--` indicate that the group has read-only permissions.
  - The final three characters `r--` indicate that all other users have read-only permissions.

- `1` is the number of hard links: This number indicates how many names (i.e., hard links) point to the data of this particular file. A value of 1 is typical for files.

- `cc` is the owner name: This file is owned by the user 'cc'.

- `staff` is the group name: 'staff' is the name of the group that has access to this file.

- `1.4K` is the file size: The size of the file is about 1.4 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:27` is the last modification timestamp: The file was last modified on July 16 at 12:27.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_49.md` is the file path: This is the path to the file. In this case, it's a Markdown file located in the directory `memory/results/tasks`.
