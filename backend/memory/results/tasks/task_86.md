# Task 86

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.5K Jul 16 12:29 memory/results/tasks/task_56.md

**Result:**
The text you've shared is not a directive but rather an example of how file information might be displayed in a *nix-style command line interface.

Here's a breakdown of each part:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This shows the file permissions. 'rw' means the user can read/write, and 'r' means all others can read from the file but not write to it.
- `1`: Number of links to the file.
- `cc`: This is the username of the file's owner.
- `staff`: the group who owns the file.
- `2.5K`: This is the size of the file in kilobytes.
- `Jul 16 12:29`: This is the date and time of the last modification made to the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_56.md`: This is the pathname to the file. In this case, the file's name is `task_56.md` and it's located in the folder `tasks` which is inside the folder `results` under `memory`.

Let me know if there's a specific aspect you're interested in, or something else you'd like to learn.
