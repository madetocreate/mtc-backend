# Task 56

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.1K Jul 16 12:21 memory/results/tasks/task_26.md

**Result:**
It seems like you've pasted a line from the output of a `ls -l` command in Unix, which lists the files in a directory along with their details.

Here's what each part of this line means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. This set of characters indicates what the file owner, group, and others can do with the file. When it begins with a `-`, it means this is a regular file (d for directory, l for symbolic link). The next three characters (`rw-`) are the permissions for the file owner - in this case, read and write. The next three (`r--`) are the permissions for the group, and the final three are for all others. Both of these last sets only have `r--`, which means read permission.

- `1`: This is the number of links to the file. For a file, this is usually 1.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group the file belongs to.

- `2.1K`: This is the size of the file. K stands for kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:21`: This is the date when the file was last modified.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_26.md`: This is the name of the file.

Let me know if you have further questions about these details!
