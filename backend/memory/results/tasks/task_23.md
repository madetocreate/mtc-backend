# Task 23

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.8K Jul 16 12:17 memory/results/tasks/task_07.md

**Result:**
It looks like you've shared the details of a file from a UNIX or UNIX-like operating system (like Linux or macOS). Here's what each part of the string means:

`-rw-r--r--`: These are the file's permissions. 

- The first `-` indicates that this is a regular file (a directory would have a `d`, and a link would have an `l`). 
- The following `rw-` means that the user (owner) has permissions to read (`r`) and write (`w`) the file, but not execute it (`-`).
- The next `r--` means that the group has read permissions but not write or execute permissions.
- The final `r--` signifies that all other users also have read permissions but not write or execute permissions.

`1`: This shows the number of links (or directories) that include a reference to this file.

`cc`: This is the username of the owner of the file.

`staff`: This is the group the file belongs to.

`1.8K`: This is the size of the file, it's 1.8 Kilobytes.

`Jul 16 12:17`: This is the last modified date and time of the file, which is July 16 at 12:17.

`memory/results/tasks/task_07.md`: This is the file's path or name. It suggests that this file is named `task_07.md` and it is located within the `tasks` directory, which is in the `results` directory, which is within the `memory` directory.
