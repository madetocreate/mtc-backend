# Task 16

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   172B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_03_template.md

**Result:**
You've provided me with a Unix-style line of file system information. Here's what it means:

`-rw-r--r--`: These are the file's permissions. The `rw` at the start means that the owner (cc) can read and write to the file. The next `r--` means that the group (staff) has read-only access. The last `r--` means that all other users also have read-only access.

`1`: This is the number of links (hard links) to the file. In this case, it's 1.

`cc`: This is the owner of the file.

`staff`: This is the group that the file is associated with.

`172B`: This is the size of the file. It's 172 bytes.

`Jul 16 11:12`: This is the last modification time of the file. It was last modified on July 16th at 11:12.

`memory/results/tasks/task_03_template.md`: This is the path and name of the file. Its path is `memory/results/tasks/` and the filename is `task_03_template.md`.
