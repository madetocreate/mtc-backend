**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_15_template.md

**Result:**
The information provided is a file listing obtained typically from a Unix-like operating system (like Linux or MacOS). Here is what each part of the information means:

**-rw-r--r--**: This part shows the file permissions.

- The first character `-` indicates the type of file. Here, `-` means it's a regular file (not a directory or a link, etc).
- The next three characters `rw-` specify the file owner's permissions, which are `read` and `write` in this case -- denoted by the `rw`, while `-` means no `execute` permissions.
- The next three characters `r--` specify the group's permissions, which is only `read` in this case.
- The final three characters `r--` specify the permissions for everyone else (not the user, not the group), which again is only `read`.

**1**: This is the number of hard links to this file.

**cc**: This is the owner of the file. In this case, a user called 'cc' owns the file.

**staff**: This is the group that owns the file. In this case, the 'staff' group owns the file.

**173B**: This denotes the file size, which is 173 bytes here.

**Jul 16 11:12**: This is the time the file last modified.

**memory/results/tasks/task_15_template.md**: This is the complete path to the file. The file is named `task_15_template.md`, located inside multiple directories as shown.
