# Task 42

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_16_template.md

**Result:**
The line provided denotes a file list output in a Unix/Linux terminal. Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part shows the file permissions. In Linux, the permissions are divided into three sets of triples for the file owner, the group, and others. The first dash signifies that it's a regular file (a 'd' would denote a directory). Next, 'rw-' means the owner has read/write access but no execution access. The second 'r--' states that group members can read but can't write or execute, and the last 'r--' implies that others also only have read access.

- `1`: This specifies the number of links to the file. In this case, there is only one link.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group to which the file belongs.

- `173B`: This shows the file size, here it's 173 bytes.

- `Jul 16 11:12`: This is the last modification date and time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_16_template.md`: This is the absolute path of the file including the file's name (`task_16_template.md`) and its location (`memory/results/tasks/`).
