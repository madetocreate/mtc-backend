# Task 105

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.8K Jul 16 11:57 memory/results/tasks/task_75.md

**Result:**
The string you posted seems to be a UNIX/Linux file permission representation including additional information about a specific file.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part describes the permissions for the file. The first character `-` signifies this is a regular file (a directory would be indicated by `d`). The next three characters `rw-` indicate the user who owns the file (`cc` in this case) has read and write permissions but cannot execute the file. The next three characters `r--` mean the group associated with the file (`staff` in this context) can only read the file. Lastly, the final `r--` means other users can also only read the file.

- `1`: This suggests there is only one link to the file.

- `cc`: This is the username of the file's owner.

- `staff`: This represents the group ownership of the file.

- `1.8K`: This is the size of the file. Here, itâ€™s 1.8 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 11:57`: This is the last modification date and time of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_75.md`: This is the file's path and name. It's a Markdown file indicated by the .md extension.
