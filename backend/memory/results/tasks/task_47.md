# Task 47

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   621B Jul 16 12:19 memory/results/tasks/task_19.md

**Result:**
The text describes a particular file in a Unix-like system, providing details about its permissions, owner, group, size, last modification time and name. Here's a breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--` - These are the file permissions. The user who owns the file (`cc`) can read and write the file, while members of the group (`staff`) and others can only read the file.
- `1` - Indicates the number of hard links that exist to this file.
- `cc` - The name of the user that owns the file. It appears that a user named `cc` owns this file.
- `staff` - The name of the group owning the file. It seems that the `staff` group is assigned to this file.
- `621B` - The file size, which in this case is 621 Bytes.
- `Jul 16 12:19` - The date and time of the last modifications to the file. So this file was last changed on July 16th at 12:19.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_19.md` - The full file name. In this case, it's a markdown file named `task_19.md`, nested within the `tasks` directory, which is inside the `results` directory, which is in turn in the `memory` directory.

Let me know if you need help with anything else.
