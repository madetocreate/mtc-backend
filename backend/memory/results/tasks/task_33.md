# Task 33

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.6K Jul 16 12:18 memory/results/tasks/task_12.md

**Result:**
The string you have provided represents file permission in Unix or Linux systems. Here's the breakdown:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file permission. 
- `1` : This is the number of links (in case of a directory, this will mean the number of contained items). 
- `cc` : This is the owner of the file.
- `staff` : This is the group the file belongs to.
- `1.6K` : This is the size of the file.
- `Jul 16 12:18` : This is the last modification date and time.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_12.md` : This is the path to the file.

Let's break down the file permissions `-rw-r--r--` further:
- `-` : The first character indicates if it is a regular file or directory. A `-` means it's a file, a 'd' would mean it's a directory.
- `rw-` : The next three characters are the file owner permissions; this owner can read and write to this file but not execute it.
- `r--` : The next three characters are the group permissions; the group can read this file but not write to it or execute it.
- `r--` : The final three characters are the permissions for others; they can read this file but not write to it or execute it.
