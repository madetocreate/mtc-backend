# Task 219

**Prompt:** finally:

**Result:**
It seems like you are talking about the `finally` keyword in programming, typically found in exception handling.

In many programming languages like JavaScript, Java, and Python, `finally` is a block of code that is part of the try...catch...finally construct. This code within the `finally` block is executed after the try and catch blocks, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught.

For example, in Python:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    # Handle the exception
finally:
    # This code gets executed no matter what
```
