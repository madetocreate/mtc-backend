# Task 81

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.6K Jul 16 12:28 memory/results/tasks/task_51.md

**Result:**
The string you've just provided seems to be expressing file permissions, ownership, size, modification date, and the name of a file in a Unix-like operating system's file system. Here is a breakdown of what it means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This part represents file permissions. The initial `-` suggests this is a regular file (as opposed to directory `d`, link `l`, etc.). The following characters are three sets of permissions: owner, group, and others. `rw-` means the owner (cc) can read and write but not execute the file. The next `r--` means members of the group (staff) can read but can't write or execute. The final `r--` means others can read but can't write or execute the file. 

- `1`: The number following the permissions is the hard link count of the file, but is always 1 for files.

- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.

- `staff`: This is the group that owns the file.

- `1.6K`: This is the size of the file. Here it is 1.6 kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:28`: This is the last modification time of the file. This file was last modified on July 16 at 12:28.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_51.md`: The last part is the path/name of the file. This file is called `task_51.md`, and it's located in the directory `tasks` which is inside `results` which is further inside `memory`.
