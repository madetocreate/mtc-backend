# Task 71

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   463B Jul 16 12:25 memory/results/tasks/task_41.md

**Result:**
It looks like you've posted a Unix-style file listing. In this case, the line you've posted represents a single file on a Unix-based system (like Linux or MacOS).

Here's a breakdown of what each section means:

- `-rw-r--r--`: This is the file permissions section. The first character `-` denotes that this is a regular file (a `d` would denote a directory). The next three characters `rw-` mean that the owner (denoted by `cc`) can read and write but not execute the file (where r stands for 'read', w for 'write', and '-' for 'no permission / not executable'). The next three `r--` mean that the members of the file's group (denoted by `staff`) can read but cannot write or execute the file. The last three `r--` mean that other users on the system can read the file, but they can't write or execute it.
  
- `1`: This is the number of hard links to this file. In this case, there's only 1.
  
- `cc`: This is the file's owner. In this case, the owner is a user named `cc`.
    
- `staff`: This is the group ownership of this file. Here, the file is owned by the `staff` group.
    
- `463B`: This is the file size. In this case, the file size is 463 Bytes.
  
- `Jul 16 12:25`: This is the date and time that the file was last modified. Here, the file was last modified on July 16 at 12:25.
    
- `memory/results/tasks/task_41.md`: This is the file's name. In this case, the file is located in `memory/results/tasks/` directory and is named `task_41.md`.
