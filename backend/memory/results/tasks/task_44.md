# Task 44

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   173B Jul 16 11:12 memory/results/tasks/task_17_template.md

**Result:**
The text provided appears to be file details in a Unix-style listing format. Let's break it down:

- "-rw-r--r--": This is the file permissions. The first character '-' symbolizes it's a regular file (not a directory, link, etc.). The next three characters 'rw-' mean that the owner of the file has read and write permissions but not execute. The next three 'r--' show that users from the user's group can only read the file, and the last three characters 'r--' denote that other users can also only read the file.

- "1": It's the number of file system links that exist to this file.

- "cc": This represents the username of the file's owner. In this case, 'cc' is the owner.

- "staff": It is the name of the group that owns the file.

- "173B": This is the file size (173 bytes). 

- "Jul 16 11:12": This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- "memory/results/tasks/task_17_template.md": It's the pathname or the location of the file in the system. This file appears to be a Markdown file, as indicated by the .md extension.
