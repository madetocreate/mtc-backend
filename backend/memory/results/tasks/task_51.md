# Task 51

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   2.0K Jul 16 12:20 memory/results/tasks/task_21.md

**Result:**
The text you've posted is a representation of a file in a Unix-like file system.

Here are the details:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These 10 characters are the file permissions. The first character `-` tells that it is a regular file (a directory would be indicated by `d`). After that, the next three characters `rw-` tell that the user who owns the file (`cc` in this case) has read (`r`) and write (`w`) permissions but not execute permission (`-`). Then the next three characters `r--` indicate that the group that owns the file (here, `staff`) only has read permission. The final three characters `r--` show that all other users also have only read permission.

- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file.

- `cc` : This is the name of the owner of the file.

- `staff` : This is the group that owns the file.

- `2.0K` : This is the size of the file, which is 2.0 Kilobytes.

- `Jul 16 12:20` : This is the date and time of the last modification of the file.

- `memory/results/tasks/task_21.md`: This is the path to the file. It is a markdown file `.md` named `task_21.md`, located within the `tasks` folder, which is in the `results` folder, which is itself located in the `memory` directory.
