# Task 9

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff    11B Jul 16 11:07 memory/results/tasks/task_01_audit_results.md

**Result:**
The string you've provided appears to be a line from a Unix or Linux ls -l long-format directory listing. 

In detail:

- `-rw-r--r--`: These are the file permissions. This string can be broken down as follows. `-` signifies a regular file, `rw-` the file owner has read and write permissions, the second `r--` indicates the group has read permissions, and the final `r--` represents the others (everyone else) has read permissions too.
- `1`: This is the number of hard links to the file.
- `cc`: This is the owner of the file.
- `staff`: This is the group the file belongs to.
- `11B`: This is the size of the file â€“ in this case, 11 bytes.
- `Jul 16 11:07`: This is the date and time of the last modification.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_01_audit_results.md`: This is the name of the file, including its path. 

So in plain English, this line tells us that 'task_01_audit_results.md' is a regular file of size 11 bytes, last modified on July 16 at 11:07. The file is owned by user 'cc' and belongs to the group 'staff'. The owner can read and write the file, while the group and others only have read access.
