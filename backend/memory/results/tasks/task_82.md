# Task 82

**Prompt:** -rw-r--r--  1 cc  staff   1.5K Jul 16 12:28 memory/results/tasks/task_52.md

**Result:**
This line looks like it's listing out the details of a file on a Linux or Unix-like system. Allow me to break it down:

- `-rw-r--r--` : This is the file-access permissions. It translates into:
  - `rw-` : the owner (here denoted `cc`) can read and write but can't execute the file
  - `r--` : members of the group (`staff`) can read the file but can't write or execute it
  - `r--` : everyone else can also read the file but can't write or execute it
- `1` : this is the number of hard links to the file. In simple terms, the file exists in one location on your computer.
- `cc` : this appears to be the username of the owner of the file.
- `staff` : this seems to be the group the file belongs to. On macOS, all users belong to the `staff` group.
- `1.5K` : this is the size of the file. In this case, it's 1.5 kilobytes.
- `Jul 16 12:28` : this is the last modified date & time of the file.
- `memory/results/tasks/task_52.md` : this is the full path and name of the file. It's a markdown file `.md`, usually used for documentation.

So, this is a 1.5 Kb markdown file that was last modified on 16th July at 12:28. The file owner `cc`, a member of the `staff` group, has read and write access to the file, while the group members and other users only have read access.
